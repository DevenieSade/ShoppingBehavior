# Method
Step 1. To perfom an exploratory data analysis to generate visualizations to find patterns and outliers
Step 2. Data transformation was conducted to clean and transform our dataset to remove missing data set
Step 3. After completion of our data cleaning, the dataset is analysis to determine




We opted to employ various packages for executing the Machine Learning modeling process. Initially, we performed data pre-processing, addressing missing data through imputation and applying the necessary dummy encoding.

Acquiring additional data on European ski resorts and exploring more advanced grouping algorithms constitutes a valuable initial step. While the existing dataset serves as a solid proof of concept and starting point, it would be intriguing to observe how it performs with larger datasets.
